# 🎞️ RAYOFROADS — A CINEMATIC ODYSSEY ON THE WEB

**RayOfRoads** is more than a website — it is a **film you scroll through**, a visually poetic journey carved from roads, mountains, temples, waterfalls, and golden sunsets.  
Every section is crafted like a **scene**, every transition like a **cut**, and every visual like a **frame from a film reel**.

Step into a world where travel meets cinema.  
Where storytelling meets design.  
Where the web becomes a motion picture.
